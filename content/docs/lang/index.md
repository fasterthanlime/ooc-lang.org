## The ooc language in a few chapters

The language has grown over the years, but it's still relatively tidy.
Here's a list of sections of the language documentation:

 1. The [Modules](/docs/lang/modules/) chapter discusses `.ooc` files, what
    a module is, what a package is, how imports and includes work.

 2. The [Values](/docs/lang/values/) chapter talks number literals, string
    literals, operators, variable declarations, and a few built-in types.

 3. The [Control Structures](/docs/lang/control-structures/) chapter describes
    mundane constructs like if, else, for, while, break, continue, but also
    match.

 4. The [Data Structures](/docs/lang/data-structures/) chapter talks about
    arrays and maps, among other things.

 5. The [Functions](/docs/lang/functions/) chapter will teach you anything
    from declaring function to calling them, to using external functions
    (from a C library, for example), but also variable arguments, default
    arguments, first-class functions and a nice syntax for closures.

 6. The [Classes](/docs/lang/classes/) chapter is here to help you realize
    that ooc classes are a lot like Java classes, except when they are not.
    Constructors, inheritance, abstract methods, initializers, and even
    interfaces have found their way in here.

 7. The [Operators](/docs/lang/operators/) chapter lists various mathematic
    and logic operators, their priorities, how to overload them, etc.

 8. The [Covers](/docs/lang/covers/) chapter discusses a construct halfway
    between C structs and ooc classes, that is a major actor in making C
    libraries easier to use.

 9. The [Enums](/docs/lang/enums/) chapter goes over the last kind of ooc
    types - an enumeration of things. How to define them, use them, you
    name it. (No, seriously, anonymous enums don't exist)

 10. The [Tuples](/docs/lang/tuples/) chapter explains what tuples are and
    what they aren't. It covers multi-return, multi-declaration, variable
    swapping, and cover literals.

 11. The [Generics](/docs/lang/generics/) chapter talks about parameterized
    types, how to define them, how to use them, what are their strong points
    and their shortcomings.

 12. The [Exceptions](/docs/lang/exceptions/) chapter talks about error
    handling, how to throw and catch Exceptions, and how to create your own
    exception types.

 13. The [Preprocessor](/docs/lang/preprocessor/) describes what happens to
    the code before it is even compiled.

language, feel free to ask on our discussion group (see
